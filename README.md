![lsp](/jai_lsp.gif)

This is a language server for the jai language. The goal is to provide the following IDE features:

1) semantic syntax highlighting:  needs work.

2) code navigation
    * goto definition - mostly working
    * find references - not started
    * hover           - mostly working

3) diagnostics: squiggles for unknown identifiers.

4) code completion
     * top level definitions: mostly working
     * member access:         mostly working
     * using statement:       not started
     * parameters:            not started

  build instructions forthcoming, because there are still some things that are fairly hardcoded to my environment.
  If you are super interested in using this, please contact me on The Secret Beta Discord @pyromuffin, and I'll see if I can help you.
